/**
 PathService::extractFilePathFromString() receives a string and expected number of paths inside it
 If path contains spaces, it must be wrapped with quotes, for example: cp "./path-to-file/file name with space.txt".
 But if we are expecting only one file in function, for example cat new file.txt -- then we can not use quotes.
 So quotes in required as wrapper for path/filename only if >= 2 entities are expected as arguments.
 So acceptable combinations for entering paths:  cp "folder 1" "folder 2", cp folder-no-space "folder 2", cp "folder space" folder-no-space, cp folder-no-space1 no-space2
